# Course_Forum

### Author: ZHL, ZYP

This is a simple course forum platform designed with React (front-end) and Python Flask (back-end API, provided in nodules/api).

## Imports: 
- React: listed in the “package.json” file. 
- Python: Python 3.8.0, Flask 2.0.1, flask-cors
(the last two packets are installed in the Python virtual environment in the image).

## Starting the React project on the server side (port map 3000:3000):
```
cd /home/IT5007/nodules
npm run compile
npm start
```

## Staring the Flask backend API: 
```
cd /home/IT5007/nodules
(source venv/bin/activate    # activate the Python virtual environment for the project if start by loading the image)
python server.py
```

Now you can visit the web page by http://localhost:3000.
