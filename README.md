## Instructions to run the project

### Step 0: Preparations
First of all, please make sure MongoDB has been installed with mongod process running. 
We choose to use the Ubuntu (20.04.3 LTS) image with MongoDB (version 5.0.3) provided on Docker Hub, and it works fine with this project. To get the image from Docker Hub, please use this command on your **host machine with Docker**:
```
docker pull mongo
```
Next, create a container with the image that links port 3000 and 5000 to the localhost:
```
docker run -dit --name <container_name> -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 mongo
```
For the system that runs the project, please ensure that the following packages have been installed:
```
apt update
apt upgrade
apt install git
apt install python3    # 3.8.10
apt install pip
apt install curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
# restart the container to enable nvm
nvm --version    # 0.39.0
nvm install --lts    # should be v16.13.0 at that time
npm --version    # 8.1.0
```
