Students learn to design and develop modern applications that support multiple clients across different platforms such as desktop, mobile devices and cloud. The course covers designing (1) website-based front-end software and (2) mobile app front-end that interacts with a common cloud-based backend. The final part involves engineering software for higher-level objectives such as security and performance. Tools and techniques for writing modern software, such as, HTML5, CSS3, React.js, Node.js, MySQL/MongoDB, and Git will be taught. ",
